            <h4>Biography</h4>
            <p>
              Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and
              Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the
              state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of
              Bengal Province in British India.[ai][aj] Prabhavati, or
              familiarly Mā jananī (lit. 'mother'), the anchor of family life,
              had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas
              was the ninth child and the sixth son.

            <h4>Ideology</h4>
            <p>
              Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great
              source of inspiration for the struggle against the British.[119]
              Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist
              thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all
              inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days.
